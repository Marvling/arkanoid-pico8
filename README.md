# arkanoid-pico8

/very early development, learning lua as I make this/
an arkanoid clone with a twist for the pico-8 fantasy console

## Breif

Arkanoid clone where the player bounces eggs. When the eggs hit the walls they hatch. The birds that come out off eggs lay other eggs.
The player has to keep both the eggs and the birds from falling while trying to break the bricks
